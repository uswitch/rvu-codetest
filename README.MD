# RVU Code Test

## Purpose 

The code test is designed for candidates to demonstrate that they can take a problem and build a well designed solution following good design practices.  

## How long do I have to complete?  

We don't have a strict time limit on submissions and acknowldge that spare time to work on this may be limited. We endeavor to respond to submissions within a couple days so an earlier submission will allow us to progresss
We don't want you to rush but equally don't want you to overthink the problem.

## What does good look like?

In essence, we are looking for evidence of programming ability and a solution that meets the requirements. The code should be well designed with appropriate speration of concerns, easy to read and clearly communicate intent. Your soliution will provide a foundation to the the in-office coding interview interview, which will be an extension of this exercise.

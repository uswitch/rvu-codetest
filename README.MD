# RVU Code Test

## Purpose 

The code test is designed for candidates to demonstrate that they can take a problem and build a well designed solution following good design practices.  

## How long do I have to complete?  

We don't have a strict time limit on submissions and acknowldge that spare time to work on this may be limited. We don't want you to rush but equally don't want you to overthink the problem. Naturally, the sooner you submit the sooner we can provide feedback. We endevour to respond to submissions within 1-2 working days.

## What does good look like?

In essence, we are looking for evidence of programming ability and a solution that meets the requirements. The code should be well designed with appropriate seperation of concerns, easy to read and clearly communicate intent. Your solution will provide a foundation to the the in-office coding interview interview, which will be an extension of this exercise.

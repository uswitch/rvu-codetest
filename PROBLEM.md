# Uswitch Energy Comparison

Choosing an energy supplier is a difficult job. There are many suppliers with
different plans and prices that vary by how much energy a customer consumes.

Your task is to help make the customer's decision easier by writing a program that:

* Prices plans on the market according to how much energy is used
* Calculates how much energy is used according to how much a customer spends each month on a specific plan

We provide automated acceptance scenarios for the expected program
behaviour, available for Ruby and JavaScript. Please choose the
language you feel most comfortable with.

This document outlines how to execute the scenarios in order to verify
correct solution behaviour. You may find it helpful to write
additional unit tests. We also include a little background
information on the problem domain.

### The plans data

We provide some example energy market data in `plans.json`

Below is an example of one such plan;

```json
[
  {
    "supplier":        "sse",
    "plan":            "standard",
    "rates":           [
      {"price": 13.5, "threshold": 150},
      {"price": 11.1, "threshold": 100},
      {"price": 10}
    ],
    "standing_charge": 9
  }
  ...
]
```

Plans contain a `supplier` & `plan`, which are identifier of who
supplies that energy and name of the plan.  They also include `rates`
which indicate how much the customer will be charged for each
kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy that they use. Additionally, plans may
also include a daily standing charge.

A plan can have multiple rates which charge a different `price` at
each rate. Each `rate` also includes a `threshold` which is the amount
of kWhs a user can consume at that price before moving to the next rate. The
last rate will not have a threshold. Rates without a threshold have no
limit on kWh usage.

In the example above, the first 150kWh will be charged at 13.5p/kWh,
the next 100kWh will be charged at 11.1p/kWh and all subsequent
consumption will be charged at 10p/kWh.

Plans can also (sometimes) include a `standing_charge`, which is a
static amount in pence which is added as a daily cost. For example, a
standing charge of 10p/day would cost Â£36.50 over the year.

Note that:

* Prices are stated in pence **exclusive** of VAT.
* Standing charge is a daily charge stated in pence exclusive of VAT and is applied regardless of consumption.
* VAT for Energy is rated at 5%.

## Your solution

Your task is to produce a program that implements two commands

+ `price` - To return the cost of each plan for a given kWh usage, sorted by cheapest
+ `usage` - To return the amount of kWh you can use for a given plan and monthly spend

We have provided a skeleton of the code to get you started in both
`JS` & `Ruby`.  This is available in the `/js/lib/energy-market.js` &
`/ruby/lib/energy_market.rb` directories.

You should update those files with your solution.

### Feature scenarios

To help validate your program works, we have outlined the intended
behaviour for both in **feature files** .**Feature files**, a natural language
description of the intended behaviour of your program given different
inputs.

```html
Feature: Price plans based on usage
    Energy switchers want to see the cheapest energy tarrifs based on their usage

    Scenario: Find the cheapest energy plans when usage low
        Given the plans provided
        When annual usage is 1000 kwh
        Then the cheapest plans are
        | supplier | plan name          | price  |
        | eon      | variable           | 108.68 |
        | edf      | fixed              | 111.25 |
        | ovo      | standard           | 120.23 |
        | bg       | standing-charge    | 121.33 |

    Scenario: Find the cheapest energy plans when usage high
        Given the plans provided
        When annual usage is 2000 kwh
        Then the cheapest plans are
        | supplier | plan name          | price  |
        | edf      | fixed              | 205.75 |
        | eon      | variable           | 213.68 |
        | bg       | standing-charge    | 215.83 |
        | ovo      | standard           | 235.73 |


Feature: Calculate annual usage in kWh from a monthly spend
    Scenario: Standard Plan
        Given the plans provided
        When supplier name is "ovo"
        And plan name is "standard"
        And monthly spend is 1000 pounds
        Then annual usage is 103855 kWh

    Scenario: Fixed Plan
        Given the plans provided
        When supplier name is "edf"
        And plan name is "fixed"
        And monthly spend is 350 pounds
        Then annual usage is 44267 kWh

     Scenario: Standing Charge
        Given the plans provided
        When supplier name is "bg"
        And plan name is "standing-charge"
        And monthly spend is 120 pounds
        Then annual usage is 14954 kWh
```

### Checking your solution

You can verify that your program solution works by executing the
automated scenarios

#### Ruby

You will require [bundler](https://bundler.io)

You can test your installation with: `bundle -v`

To run the feature scenarios;

```sh
cd {coding-test-dir}/ruby
bundle
cucumber

```

#### JS

You will require a working node and npm installation. Verify that Node.js is installed properly:

Execute the scenarios

```sh
cd {coding-test-dir}/js
npm install
npm test

```

We will verify your solution passess the automated scenarios provided.

### Tips

You are welcome to write your solution in a language you feel
confident in. Your program must pass the automated scenarios provided
